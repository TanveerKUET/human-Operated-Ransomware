We have studied 2 types of analysis data and collected 3 datasets which are

	1. Static Analysis
	
		Datset: Ransomware.csv
		source: M. Masum, M. J. H. Faruk, H. Shahriar, K. Qian, D. Lo, and M. I. Adnan, “Ransomware Classification and Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms,” 2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference, CCWC 2022, pp. 316–322, 2022, doi: 10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720869

	2. Dynamic Analysis
	
		Dataset 1: sensors-2047104-supplementary.csv
		source   : J. A. Herrera-Silva and M. Hernández-Álvarez, “Dynamic Feature Dataset for Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms,” Sensors, vol. 23, no. 3, p. 1053, Jan. 2023, doi:10.3390/s23031053
		
		Dataset 2: API_1_232.csv
		source   : W. Song et al., {UNVEIL}: A {Large-Scale}, Automated Approach to Detecting Ransomware. 2016. Accessed: Dec. 15, 2024. [Online]. Available: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technicalsessions/presentation/song
	
	Note: API_1_232.csv has been derived from original source RansomwareData.csv 

We have prepared 3 scripts to perform our study

241-CoE540-551-Project_Static_Analysis_Dataset.ipynb
241-CoE540-551-Project_Dynamic_Analysis_Dataset1.ipynb
241-CoE540-551-Project_Dynamic_Analysis_Dataset2.ipynb

these scripts have been created through Google CoLab. Details are showed in the scripts in text.

How to run the scripts

1. Import the scripts in google colab
2. Import the datasets csv files in the same directory of the colab
3. update the link of the dataset on the ipynb scripts
4. Run each cell on the script step by step that will produce the the results
